** Tough points
- Added a button to show/hide details view for a given message, but it doesn't force a page rerender. Wasn't able to figure out how to fix that.
- Adding the logic to create a new membership (in the channels index) was a lot of work, given that it is a many-to-many polymorphic association
- Got sucked into styling and distracted from some of the major goals I had set out to accomplish

** Thoughts
- A tough day. I did not finish components in the time that I had estimated. Friday.
- I significantly underestimated the amount of time that it would take me to build the forums (channels) component. The two factors that I underestimated there were (1) the fact that creating forums also meant creating the join table (memberships) and (2) the fact that to display the forums component (~/messages/:forumName~) I would have to build the main view of the entire application.
- The main problem here was estimation not productivity. I think I'm working at a reasonable pace and that my estimation was inaccurate.
- In general, I'm very happy that I've taken a user-centric view. Whenever possible, I've created views with dummy data before adding the backend to send the data. That has meant that after I finish adding in the backend it is very easy to plug it into the front end view that I've already made. It has allowed me to split concerns and focus on display separately from information. It has also meant that I almost always have a visual to /show/ for my work.

- On a flexed component, set height with ~vh~ not ~%~. ~100vh~ will fill the whole screen.

** Dead Ends
- I tried to start testing using Jest and Enzyme. I was able to write a successful simple test in ES5 syntax, but writing anything in ES6 syntax was throwing errors. I will have to postpone JavaScript testing.
