#+TITLE: Come Back
Tasks to come back to, temporarily postponed
* Add avatars to users
* Make sure that backed ~ensure_signed_in~ lines up with frontend permissions
- In other words, you can't use the console to go to pages you shouldn't otherwise be able to see
* Multiple login
- Behavior
  - In the console
  - Sign in as a user
  - Sign in as another user
  - No error is thrown
- Is this a problem? Should you have to sign out first?
* Convert join link on splash page to button
* Add 'product' to navbars
* Better Big button hover effect
* Add small text at the bottom of the splash page
- To sign in instead
* Add small text to the bottom of the forms
- For other sign in options
* Remove production error message
: Warning: It looks like you're using a minified copy of the development build of React. When deploying React apps to production, make sure to use the production build which skips development warnings and is faster. See https://fb.me/react-minification for more details.
* Require logged in for messages page
* Back button protection
- now if you sign in and then hit the back button enough, you can be redirected to the sign in / try page. It would be better to prevent access to those pages if signed in.
* Add border change on selected field
* Remove original greeting view ("Hi so and so")
* Add a link to refresh the pair choice for try
* Replace sign out button on messages page
- Tried to set up font awesome, unsuccessfully
* Add backshadow to button text
- Hard to read
* Add a note for guests
- "Don't like these guests? Get more:"
- Probably add a button. I could just tell them to refresh
* Clear errors
- Recreate:
  - try an invalid sign in
  - then go to join
  - errors will persist
  - instead they should be cleared
* Qbot for bots
* Sort users / channels
- Alphabetical
- Could also sort by most recent sign in (or put ones that have signed in today at the top). This would be an easy workaround to figuring out who's online
* Fix position of navbar
* Extract only necessary information about users forums
_user.json.jbuilder
* Fix position of header for forum details
