#+TITLE: Maybe Later
Things I might do later, but am definitely not doing now
* Store full names for users and bots
- For now, username is enough for both
* Store users emails
- For now, username is enough
* Host at ~slack.jasonreeder.com~
* Transition to StandardJS instead of ESLint
* Add extra items to the bottom of the splash page
- Links to the GH repo
- Links to my personal website
- links to this reflections repo
* Good password validation
- The default gemfile has the following line, which might be helpful
  : Use ActiveModel has_secure_password
