* add in new forum greetings
* Slack-style button hovers
* improve splash & auth
** encourage signing up as guest on other auth views
** breakpoints on splash
* allow seeing more guests

** only update guests once per day
- or maybe just skip this
** test
- if I open the app up in two browsers, do I see the same user
* transition to auto messages for bots
** stop sending auto messages twice
- Am I requesting show twice?
*** When am I requesting message show?
*** How do I reduce this to once per new message?
*** once this is done
**** improve greeting flow
***** messages guest users after log in, instead of seeding
***** messages new users after log in (this doesn't exist yet at all)
